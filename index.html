            <p>
              At the age of 16, I started to work in the insurance industry as an apprentice. This apprenticeship not only taught me the industry, but cross-functional collaboration and communication as well.
              During this first year, I've been awarded with the highest performer in Western Switzerland. Later on, I decided to join the University of Applied Science Western Switzerland to study
              a bachelor in International Business & Management. During my last semester, I raised my passion for data & analytics. I decided to pursue a MS in Business Analytics abroad, but covid hit and I had to reschedule my plans.
              In the meantime, I joined a leading credit-insurance company as an account executive, and I have quickly been promoted as a Key Account Manager for the Global Solutions. I really enjoyed the high level communication with top executives 
              from multinationals headquarted in Switzerland. I was responsible for their global credit-insurance company for their worldwide affiliated.
              I left Switzerland in July 2023 to pursue my MS in Business Analytics at UC San Diego. During my time at UCSD, I've been awarded the Beta Gamma Sigma honour, a recognition for the top 10% performing students
              of the cohort. 
              Aiming to shift my career into analytics as a Data Scientist, I am working on some hands-on project and I am currently doing a Data Analyst internship for a SaaS company.

          Hi! If you're here, then you're interested in my profile so let me tell you a little bit about me.

          1. I love data. After many successful years as a Key Account Manager - consulting multinationals for their global insurance program, I decided to shift my career into analytics and pursued my MS in Business Analytics at UC San Diego
          2. I am a very curious and fast learner. As I quickly grasp new concepts, I am always willing to support my peers when required and contribute to their success.
          3. I genuinely love making others happy. As cheesy as it might sound, I am very a sociable and I love connecting with new people from different backgrounds.
           
          Are you even more curious now? Feel free to reach out to me.
        </p>
