            <p>
              At 16, I began my career in the insurance industry as an apprentice, learning the industry and developing cross-functional collaboration and communication skills. In my first year, I was recognized as the highest performer in Western Switzerland. I then pursued a Bachelor's in International Business & Management at the University of Applied Science Western Switzerland.
              During my final semester, I discovered a passion for data and analytics, leading me to pursue an MS in Business Analytics abroad. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced me to delay these plans. Meanwhile, I joined a leading credit-insurance company as an account executive and was quickly promoted to Key Account Manager for Global Solutions. I enjoyed high-level communication with top executives from multinational companies headquartered in Switzerland and managed their global credit insurance.
              In July 2023, I left Switzerland to pursue my MS in Business Analytics at UC San Diego, where I was awarded Beta Gamma Sigma honors, recognizing the top 10% of students. Now aiming to shift my career to analytics as a Data Scientist, I am working on hands-on projects and currently interning as a Data Analyst for a SaaS company.

          Hi! If you're here, then you're interested in my profile so let me tell you a little bit about me.

          1. I love data. After many successful years as a Key Account Manager - consulting multinationals for their global insurance program, I decided to shift my career into analytics and pursued my MS in Business Analytics at UC San Diego
          2. I am a very curious and fast learner. As I quickly grasp new concepts, I am always willing to support my peers when required and contribute to their success.
          3. I genuinely love making others happy. As cheesy as it might sound, I am very a sociable and I love connecting with new people from different backgrounds.
           
          Are you even more curious now? Feel free to reach out to me.
        </p>
